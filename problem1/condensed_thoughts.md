# Condensed Thoughts

Purpose:
- This file is the informal argument workspace for this problem.
- All models/subagents should draft, refine, and critique concise reasoning here before or alongside formal proof work.

Rules:
- Keep it concise and structured.
- Record claim, assumptions, key lemmas/steps, and unresolved gaps.
- Update this file as understanding improves; do not leave stale reasoning.
- For solving tasks, do not edit `problemN_formalisation.lean`; put proof attempts in `solution.lean`.

Suggested structure:
1. Problem restatement
2. Core idea (2-6 lines)
3. Key lemmas needed
4. Candidate proof/disproof outline
5. Failure modes / edge cases
6. Current status and next action
