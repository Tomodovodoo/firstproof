# firstproof

Lean formalization workspace for selected problems.

- Problem statements are stored as Markdown files at `Firstproof/Problem*/proofdocs/problem.md`.
- Only **Problem 9** is solved.
- Toolchain is pinned to **Lean v4.22.0** (`lean-toolchain`), and the Problem 9 proof is compatible with Lean v4.24.
- Problems **4** and **6** are formalized/copied from the DeepMind `formal-conjectures` project.
- Problem **9** was autonomously solved informally and then agentically proven in Lean.
