## Original Problem Statement (LaTeX)
```tex
Fix a finite group $G$.  Let $\aO$ denote an incomplete transfer
system associated to an $N_\infty$ operad.  Define the slice
filtration on the $G$-equivariant stable category adapted to $\aO$ and
state and prove a characterization of the $\aO$-slice connectivity of
a connective $G$-spectrum in terms of the geometric fixed points.
