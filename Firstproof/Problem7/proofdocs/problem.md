## Original Problem Statement (LaTeX)
```tex
Suppose that $\Gamma$ is a uniform lattice in a real semi-simple group, and that $\Gamma$ contains some 2-torsion. Is it possible for $\Gamma$ to be the fundamental group of a compact manifold without boundary whose universal cover is acyclic over the rational numbers $\mathbb{Q}$?
